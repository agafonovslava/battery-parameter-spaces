# Figures
Each of the main text figures are present in their own directory, along with all required data for figure generation. The supplemental figures are available in the SI directory.

All figures are created with python/matplotlib, with the exception of Figure 1 (Affinity Designer). Each figure should self-generate by running the eponymous script (e.g. fig2.py).
