This folder contains four data files:

- Qn.csv contains discharge capacity vs cycle number for all cells in the validation batch. The rows are cells, in the same order as 05-Mar-2019_batch9_predictions; the columns are increasing cycle number.
- QV_100_10.csv contains DeltaQ_{100-10}(V) difference curves for all cells in the validation batch. The rows are cells, in the same order as 05-Mar-2019_batch9_predictions; the columns are increasing voltage index (3.5 V -> 2.0 V).
- QV_EOL.csv contains DeltaQ_{EOL}(V) difference curves for all cells in the validation batch. The rows are cells, in the same order as 05-Mar-2019_batch9_predictions; the columns are increasing voltage index (3.5 V -> 2.0 V).
- QV_EOL_1.csv contains DeltaQ_{EOL-10}(V) difference curves for all cells in the validation batch. The rows are cells, in the same order as 05-Mar-2019_batch9_predictions; the columns are increasing voltage index (3.5 V -> 2.0 V).
